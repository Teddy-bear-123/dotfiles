#: Fonts {{{

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font
#: families that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick,
#: etc. For example::

font_family      Fira Code Medium
bold_font        Fira Code Bold
italic_font      Victor Mono Medium Italic
bold_italic_font Victor Mono Bold Italic

font_features FiraCode-Medium +cv01 +cv02 +cv05 +ss01 +ss03 +cv31 +cv30
font_features FiraCode-Bold +cv01 +cv02 +cv05 +ss01 +ss03 +cv31 +cv30

font_size 10

adjust_line_height  140%
modify_font strikethrough_position 16px

symbol_map U+f101-U+f21d nonicons

modify_font underline_position 3
modify_font underline_thickness 150%

#: Scrollback {{{

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down resizing of the terminal and also
#: use large amounts of RAM.

#: Window layout {{{

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.

#: will be used as the startup layout. For a list of available

enabled_layouts Splits,Stack

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: minimum needed borders for inactive windows are drawn. That is only
#: the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note
#: that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all
#: borders to be drawn.
draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).
inactive_text_alpha 0.8

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders). Whether

#: manager/operating system.

#: Advanced {{{

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over ssh
#: connections.
allow_remote_control yes

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
#: individual instances. See
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html#sessions in the kitty
#: documentation for details. Note that relative paths are interpreted
#: with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment variables
#: in the path are expanded.

#: You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#: program using pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#: open program is used, but you can specify your own, for example::

#:     map ctrl+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#: You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running in
#: a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#:     map ctrl+y new_window less @selection
